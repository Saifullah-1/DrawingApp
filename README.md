# Project Description: Paint Application

## Part 1: Geometric Shapes Data Model
### 2.1 Description
Design an object-oriented model encompassing geometric shapes (Line Segment, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Rectangle, and Square) with shared properties for efficient implementation of an object-oriented drawing application.

### 2.2 Tasks
1. Develop an object-oriented model.
2. Create a UML Class diagram illustrating classes, attributes, and methods.
3. Apply inheritance and polymorphism concepts.

## Part 2: Drawing and Painting Application
### 3.1 Description
Build a popular web-based drawing and painting application with a vast feature set, including drawing, coloring, resizing, and undo/redo functionalities. Integrate a variety of built-in and extensible geometric shapes.

### 3.2 Tasks
1. Implement the geometric shapes model.
2. Design and implement a GUI supporting Draw, Color, Resize, Move, Copy, and Delete functionalities.
3. Enable undo/redo actions.
4. Utilize the cursor for precise shape control, allowing users to draw by mouse dragging.

## Part 3: Save and Load
### 4.1 Description
Enhance the application with the ability to save user drawings and modify them later.

### 4.2 Tasks
1. Provide an option in UI to save the drawing in XML (encoding: ISO-8859-1) and JSON file (You should implement both).
2. Provide an option to load previously saved drawings and modify the shapes.
3. Users must choose where to save the file.
